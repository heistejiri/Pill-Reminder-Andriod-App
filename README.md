  * Android Studio IDE
  * Java 
  * SQLite database ( SQLiteOpenHelper )
#### Frontend :
  * XML


### Need of Project :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health is the only thing that we should care the most. COVID-19 made all the people aware about the importance of health. In such a situation, forgetting about the medicine timings can severely affect the health of an individual. Taking this into consideration, I came up with the idea of this project. The main feature of this project is that it is `multi-user`. so that all the family members especially the elder people who generally dont have smartphones can get benefitted by saving their schedule in one of the smartphone in their family.

### Key Features :
1. #### **Offline Advantage** : As the Application works with an offline database which is stored in the device, no internet connection is required, offline storage of database helps in faster read write operations.
2. #### **Multiple Users** : Medicine timings of multiple users can be stored in the same app in same smartphone.
3. #### **Medicine Quantity** : Quantities of medicine can also be stored so that one can know, how many tablets or medicines he/she has to take.
4. #### **User Friendly UI** : The user interface is made using dynamically updating RecyclerViews, which gets updated as we made changes in database.
